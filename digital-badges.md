1FeaturesTitle: Customizable badges with dynamic metadata
1FeaturesMessage: Customizable badges have a lot of benefits. They allow you to show off your achievements, set yourself apart from your competitors, and attract new customers. However, they can also be time-consuming and expensive to produce. With MetaCards, you can create customizable badges without having to spend hours designing each one by hand. You can create design templates with dynamic data such as pictures and text, then simply replace the template with your images and text when you need to make a change. Your badge will always look fresh and up-to-date.

2FeaturesTitle: Add badge to LinkedIn and Share across 40+ Social Media
2FeaturesMessage: LinkedIn is a very popular social media platform and is often used as a way to enhance your professional career. But it’s also a great way to build your brand and can be used to share information about your work and interests. By adding a LinkedIn badge to your profile, you can let people know that you’re an expert in your field, know someone who is, or know about a topic that’s relevant to their interests.

3FeaturesTitle: Analyse and Manage your Credentials
3FeaturesMessage: Credentials are the keys to unlocking many doors. Credentialing is a key element in the success of any organization, and organizations must have a strategy for managing credentials. Being able to identify the right credential for each position and having a system in place to manage the credentials is important. You can choose the date range, country, type of credential, and more to create a report. There are multiple types of reports to choose from, like usage reports, click-through reports, email reports, and more. You can also view the performance of a particular partner, partner program, or event.

4FeaturesTitle: Integrations and bulk award
4FeaturesMessage: With the API integration, you can automatically issue badges when someone completes a course, program, or event. This saves time and is more efficient than issuing badges manually. You can also issue badges using a CSV file, which is helpful when you need to issue bulk awards. Integration with no-code platforms like Zapier and Integrated enables you to integrate CertifyMe with any other application without technical knowledge. We are also available as plugins on the most popular LMS platforms and applications.
