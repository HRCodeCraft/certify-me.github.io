alternativeTitle: Sertifier
alternativeText1: Sertifier is similar to CertifyMe in its concept design. Itâ€™s another certification platform that also aims to deliver tamper-proof credentials and badges. Sertifier serves training providers, associations, corporates, and universities with digital badges and certificates. It works to ensure the quick creation of credentials.  

alternativeText2: However, Sertifier lacks the job portal integration technique which plays a critical role in the success of the certification process. It also delivers limited information on social sharing and how many social sites it supports.

alternativeText3: Digital certificates are for social sharing. A lack of details on this can be confusing for awardees.
