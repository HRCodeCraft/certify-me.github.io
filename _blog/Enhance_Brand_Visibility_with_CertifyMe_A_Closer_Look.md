In today’s digital age, establishing a strong brand presence is essential for 
educational institutions, training providers, and organizations. Certifyme, a 
leading digital credentialing platform, offers innovative solutions to enhance 
brand visibility. Let’s delve into the facets that set Certifyme apart and how they 
contribute to brand enhancement.

# Whitelabeling Solutions

Certifyme provides <b> perfect whitelabeling solutions </b> that seamlessly integrate 
with your organization’s branding. When learners receive their digital 
credentials, the entire experience—from the credential page to the sharing 
process—feels like it’s coming directly from your institution. Here’s how it 
works:

1. **Credential Page Customization**: The credential page resembles your          
organization’s website, complete with headers, footers, logos, and color schemes. 
Learners see a cohesive brand identity, reinforcing their trust in your educational 
programs.
1. **Domain White-labeling**: With domain white-labeling, you can customize the 
URL where learners access their digital credentials. Instead of using CertifyMe’s 
default domain, you can set up a subdomain or a custom domain that aligns with your 
institution’s branding.
For example, if your organization is “MyUniversity,” you can create a custom 
URL like “certificates.myuniversity.edu” for learners to access their credentials.
1. **SMTP White-labeling**: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) white- 
labeling allows you to customize the email notifications sent to learners during the 
credentialing process.
You can configure CertifyMe to use your own SMTP server for sending emails. 
This ensures that all communication related to credentials—such as issuance 
notifications, sharing links, and reminders—comes from your institution’s email 
domain. By white-labeling SMTP, you maintain a consistent brand experience 
throughout the communication journey.
1. **Email Customization**: Customize the content and design of email 
notifications sent to learners. You can personalize the email templates with your 
institution’s branding elements, including logos, colors, and fonts.
Tailor the email messages to align with your institution’s tone and style. Whether
it’s a congratulatory email upon credential issuance or a reminder to share the 
credential, you have full control over the content.
Certifyme ensures that the focus remains on your organization. Users won’t 
perceive Certifyme as an external service; instead, they’ll associate the 
credentials with your brand.

# Social Shareability

Certifyme encourages learners to share their achievements on social media 
platforms with just one click. Here’s why these matters for brand visibility:

1. **LinkedIn Integration**: Learners can instantly share their digital badges and 
certificates on LinkedIn. As they update their profiles, your brand gains exposure to 
their professional networks.
1. **Sharing through social networking platforms**: Certifyme extends social 
shareability across platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Pinterest etc, 
through which learners can broadcast their accomplishments to a wider audience, 
creating a ripple effect of brand visibility.

# Marketing Banner and Branding Message

Certifyme goes beyond basic credentials by offering additional features that 
enhance brand visibility:

1. **Branding Space**: CertifyMe allocates dedicated space within the credential  
for your institution’s branding elements. By utilizing this branding space effectively, 
you create a cohesive and memorable experience for recipients. They’ll associate the 
credential not only with their achievement but also with your institution’s brand 
identity.
1. **Marketing Banner Image or Video**: You can include a captivating marketing
banner image or even a video (e.g., a Vimeo video) within the credential. Imagine 
showcasing a snippet of your institution’s success stories or highlighting unique 
program features. This visual element reinforces your brand and engages recipients.
1. **Branding Message with Call to Action**: CertifyMe allows you to add a 
branding message alongside the credential. Craft a compelling message that aligns 
with your brand values and encourages recipients to take action. Whether it’s visiting 
your website, exploring other courses, or sharing their achievement, this call to action 
reinforces your brand’s impact.
