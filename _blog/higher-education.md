# A University's Attempt to Achieve Sustainability through Digital Credentials

Assisted the university in Leeds reduce credentialing costs up to 39% with a laser-focus on sustainability.

### The Overview

Sustainability is a controversial issue. Universities around the world have been actively exploring sustainable practices to reduce their carbon footprint. One such initiative involves the implementation of digital credentials, an innovative approach that aims to replace traditional paper-based certificates with electronic versions. This case study examines the efforts of a Leeds-based university to embrace sustainability through the adoption of digital certificates & badges.

The university in question offers a Master's program in Environmental Change and Management. Every year 600+ students enroll in this program. But soon the institute management realizes that the authority of the educational establishment is not following sustainable practices. The credentialing rules of the university play a leading role in the lack of green solutions. Thousands of trees are cut down every year to reward the students of the university. The added cost of printing, credential delivery, and mailing them to the student's address not only increases the budget for certification programs but also impacts its green credit score. 

### The Organization

The Leeds-based university is a leading institution known for its commitment to creating a green environment. The 236-year-old educational institute started to invest in sustainable choices in the past decade. The university management identified digital credentials as a replacement for paper certificates. They partnered with a credentialing software but its lack of customer support and complex setup made them shift to traditional certificates. The production, distribution, and storage of these documents consumed significant resources, contributing to deforestation and waste generation. The university sought to leverage the digital credentials of CertifyMe to streamline its credentialing process and reduce its greenhouse effect.

### Objectives:


1. **Environmental Sustainability:** Reduce paper waste and associated carbon emissions by transitioning from paper-based certificates to digital credentials.

1. **Pilot Programme:** The pilot program conducted by the university involved a selected group of students and alumni to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the credentials. Feedback and suggestions were actively sought to fine-tune the system and address handling or set-up issues.

Averitt Hughes, the Head of the Human Resource Department of the university announced CertifyMe as ‘the best choice I have ever made’. He is the one who suggested us to the university's Sustainability Program Manager and was proud of us. According to him, ‘is a 236-year-old prestigious educational institute with an ongoing MSc program in Sustainability and Change Management, the paper certificate was affecting our reputation. For a very long time, we were scrolling through the internet and comparing & checking several credentialing platforms all over the world. But nothing met our expectations as CertifyMe.
