In today’s digital age, establishing a strong brand presence is essential for educational institutions, training providers, and organizations. CertifyMe, a leading digital credentialing platform, offers innovative solutions to enhance brand visibility. Let’s delve into the facets that set CertifyMe apart and how they contribute to brand enhancement.

<br>

## White Labeling Solutions

CertifyMe provides **perfect whitelabeling solutions** that seamlessly integrate with your organization’s branding. When learners receive their digital credentials, the entire experience—from the credential page to the sharing process—feels like it’s coming directly from your institution. Here’s how it works:
<br>

### Credential Page Customization

The credential page resembles your organization’s website, complete with headers, footers, logos, and color schemes. Learners see a cohesive brand identity, reinforcing their trust in your educational programs.
<br>

### Domain White-labeling

With domain white-labeling, you can customize the URL where learners access their digital credentials. Instead of using CertifyMe’s default domain, you can set up a subdomain or a custom domain that aligns with your institution’s branding.
For example, if your organization is “MyUniversity,” you can create a custom URL like “certificates.myuniversity.edu” for learners to access their credentials.
<br>

### SMTP White-labeling

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) white-labeling allows you to customize the email notifications sent to learners during the credentialing process.
You can configure CertifyMe to use your own SMTP server for sending emails. This ensures that all communication related to credentials—such as issuance notifications, sharing links, and reminders—comes from your institution’s email domain. By white-labeling SMTP, you maintain a consistent brand experience throughout the communication journey.
<br>

### Email Customization

Customize the content and design of email notifications sent to learners. You can personalize the email templates with your institution’s branding elements, including logos, colors, and fonts.
Tailor the email messages to align with your institution’s tone and style. Whether it’s a congratulatory email upon credential issuance or a reminder to share the credential, you have full control over the content.


**CertifyMe ensures that the focus remains on your organization. Users won’t perceive CertifyMe as an external service; instead, they’ll associate the credentials with your brand.**

<br>

## Social Shareability


CertifyMe encourages learners to share their achievements on social media platforms with just **one click**. Here’s why these matters for brand visibility:

1. **LinkedIn Integration:** Learners can instantly share their digital badges and certificates on LinkedIn. As they update their profiles, your brand gains exposure to their professional networks.

1. **Sharing through social networking platforms:** CertifyMe extends social shareability across platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Pinterest etc, through which learners can broadcast their accomplishments to a wider audience, creating a ripple effect of brand visibility.

## Marketing Banner and Branding Message
CertifyMe goes beyond basic credentials by offering additional features that enhance brand visibility:
<br>

### Branding Space
CertifyMe allocates dedicated space within the credential for your institution’s branding elements. By utilizing this branding space effectively, you create a cohesive and memorable experience for recipients. They’ll associate the credential not only with their achievement but also with your institution’s brand identity.
<br>

### Marketing Banner Image or Video
You can include a captivating marketing banner image or even a video (e.g., a Vimeo video) within the credential. Imagine showcasing a snippet of your institution’s success stories or highlighting unique program features. This visual element reinforces your brand and engages recipients.
<br>

### Branding Message with Call to Action
CertifyMe allows you to add a branding message alongside the credential. Craft a compelling message that aligns with your brand values and encourages recipients to take action. Whether it’s visiting your website, exploring other courses, or sharing their achievement, this call to action reinforces your brand’s impact.
