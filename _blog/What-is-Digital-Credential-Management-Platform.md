We’ll explore the processes involved in issuing, managing, and verifying credentials, and how these platforms integrate with other systems to enhance functionality.
<br>

### Issuing and Managing Credentials

Issuing credentials with a digital credentialing platform is streamlined and efficient. The process begins with creating digital certificates using the platform’s built-in templates. These templates can be customized to fit your brand’s style, ensuring each credential reflects your organization’s identity.

Once created, credentials are easily distributed to recipients via email or direct download links. The platform also handles ongoing management, allowing you to track and update credentials as needed. This level of digital credential management reduces administrative workload and ensures that credentials are always current and accessible.

### Verification and Validation Processes

One of the standout features of a digital credential platform is its robust verification system. When a recipient shares their digital credential, the verification process is straightforward. The recipient’s credential is checked against a secure database to confirm its authenticity, providing instant validation.

This process is not only secure but also quick, making it easy for employers, educational institutions, or any verifier to confirm the credentials without any hassle. This efficiency and security make digital credentialing software a preferred choice for many organizations looking for reliable credentialing solutions.

Each credential in CertifyMe has a verification feature embedded within it, as shown in the image below.
