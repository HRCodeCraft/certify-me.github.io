After logging in, the next step is to design your certificate template. In CertifyMe, navigate to the 'Design Template' section via the navigation bar on the left. Next, click on "Edit your credential template," which will take you to the credential template editor. Here, you have two options:

1. <b>Upload a Pre-Designed Template:</b> If you already have a certificate design ready, simply upload it to the editor.

1. <b>Create a New Design:</b> Use the integrated Canva tool to design a certificate that meets your needs. Canva offers a range of customization options, including adding your organization's logo, colors, and other design elements.

Ensure your template includes space for variable attributes, such as the recipient's name, course title, and date of completion, to personalize each certificate effectively.

## Step 4: Add Variable Attributes

Variable attributes are placeholders in the certificate template that can be personalized for each recipient. They allow for the dynamic insertion of information such as names, course titles, and dates, making each certificate unique. To add variable attributes in CertifyMe:

1. In the template design interface, locate the option to add variable fields.

1. Click on the desired area in the template to insert standard fields like the recipient's name, course name, and completion date.

1. You can also add custom variables, such as QR codes or unique number IDs, for additional security or functionality.

1. Use drag-and-drop functionality or precise placement tools to position these fields correctly on the template. 

These features ensure that each certificate is personalized and meets your specific requirements.

<br>

## Step 5: Save Your Template

After designing your certificate and adding the necessary variable attributes, it's important to fill out the program details. These details serve as the metadata for each credential, ensuring accurate and complete information is associated with every certificate issued. Be sure to fill out these fields carefully and thoroughly.

1. Enter all required program details, including the course name, issuing organization, and any other relevant information.

1. Once all details are completed, click on the "Save my Credential Template" button to save your design.

1. Name your template descriptively, making it easy to locate and reuse for future certificate distributions.

This step ensures that your certificates are well-organized and easy to manage within the CertifyMe platform.

## Step 6: Prepare and Upload a CSV File


To efficiently send multiple certificates via email, you'll need to prepare a CSV file containing the necessary recipient information:

1. Create a CSV file where each row represents a different recipient. Include columns for each variable attribute, such as Name, Course Name, and Date of Completion.
2. In CertifyMe, navigate to the "Award Credentials" page for the specific credential template you want to use.
3. Click the "Bulk Award" button, which will reveal the "Upload CSV" option along with a <a href="https://credential.certifyme.online/credentialTemplate/generateSampleCSV/17383">sample CSV</a> file you can download for reference.
4. Upload your completed CSV file, ensuring that each column aligns with the corresponding variable attribute in your certificate template.
5. Verify the data mapping to confirm that all recipient information is accurate and properly assigned.

This process allows you to efficiently manage and distribute a large number of certificates, ensuring that each recipient receives their personalized certificate.
