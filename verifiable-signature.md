1FeaturesTitle: What is Cryptographic Signature
1FeaturesMessage: A cryptographic signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document. Signatures are based on public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, which uses a pair of mutually authenticating keys – a public key and a private key – to encrypt and decrypt a message.

2FeaturesTitle: RSA
2FeaturesMessage: RSA, or Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, is the most popular asymmetric cryptographic algorithm in use today. It is primarily used for encrypting messages but can also be used for performing digital signatures over a message. Let us understand how RSA can be used for performing digital signatures step-by-step. Assume that there is a sender (A) and a receiver (B). A wants to send a message (M) to B along with the digital signature (DS) calculated over the message. First, A generates a pair of keys using RSA - a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret.

3FeaturesTitle: Securely Verify your Credentials
3FeaturesMessage: When you use your cryptographic signature to verify your credentials, you're essentially saying, "I trust this third party or issuer to vouch for my credentials." This gives your credentials added legitimacy and helps to protect them from being forged.
