4FeaturesTitle: Immutable Credentials
4FeaturesMessage: Immutable Credentials are credentials that are secure, transparent, immutable and cryptographically verifiable. These credentials can be used to authenticate an identity from a service provider to a service consumer. With immutable credentials, you control the authentication process instead of the authentication provider. This means that once you have completed signing your credentials, you cannot change them without invalidating the signature and therefore destroying your ability to authenticate as yours
